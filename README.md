This project focuses on creating an enhanced header experience for websites, blending smooth animation with a user-friendly navigation toggle.
key features:

Smooth Animation:

Captures user attention with a visually appealing introduction.
The header image gracefully slides in from the right as the content elements smoothly transition in from the left.
You can customize the transition durations and animation styles to perfectly match your website's aesthetic.

Navigation Toggle:

Improves user experience by providing effortless access to different sections of the website.
A dedicated menu button allows users to intuitively toggle the visibility of navigation links.
This collapsible menu design saves space and keeps the interface clean when not in use.
Added hover effects for buttons or navigation links.
Implementing detailed behaviors for navigation links, like preventing the default behavior and handling redirects to specific pages.
This project demonstrates my ability to combine visual appeal with user-friendly interaction. It serves as a strong foundation for building dynamic and engaging website headers, adaptable to your specific design needs and functionalities.
